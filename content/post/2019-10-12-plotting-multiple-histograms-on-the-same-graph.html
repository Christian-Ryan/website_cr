<p>Recently, while trying to compare the distribution of two samples, I discovered that you can plot both on the same graph in base R, which is a nice feature if you just want to examine the data quickly. We can explore this with a psychological dataset from the Open Psychometrics site. This hosts a range of open psychometric tests and stores the data in an accessible form. Let’s pull out the data for the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (note that there are two different scoring methods in common use on this scale - on the website they have used a 1 - 4 Likert scale for the data output as a csv, but it is not unusual to see the use of a 0 - 3 scale, (which is the method used to give participants on the website feedback) so we need to be cautious when comparing these total scores with published norms (see <a href="https://socy.umd.edu/about-us/using-rosenberg-self-esteem-scale" class="uri">https://socy.umd.edu/about-us/using-rosenberg-self-esteem-scale</a>)).</p>
<p>First we will load two packages we are going to use. We want the <strong>tidyverse</strong> for manipulating the variables and we will use the <strong>psych</strong> package for creating total scores on the measure itself.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
library(psych)</code></pre>
<p>Next we want to set an url object to direct the download.file() to the right place to pull the data. I have called it <em>my_url</em> for simplicity. We pass this as the first argument in the download.file() function. We then set a destination for the file to be saved with the <em>dest</em> argument. Finally we use unzip to unpack the zipped file.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>my_url &lt;- &quot;http://openpsychometrics.org/_rawdata/RSE.zip&quot;
download.file(url = my_url, dest=&quot;data.zip&quot;, mode=&quot;wb&quot;) 
unzip (&quot;data.zip&quot;, exdir = &quot;./&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Now we can import the data with the read_tsv() function. We can’t use the read_csv() function with the data, because despite having a .csv extension, the data is actually tab-separated not comma-separated.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>df &lt;- read_tsv(&quot;RSE/data.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>In the Rosenberg Self-Esteem scale Items 2, 5, 6, 8, 9 are normally reverse scored. However, whoever loaded the questions on the website put them in a different order, with items 3, 5, 8, 9, 10 needing reversing. We need to create a total score for the measure and to be mindful of the reverse coded items. The <em>psych</em> package provides a function for this called scoreFast. We need to pass it a list called keys.list which specifies the direction of each item in turn (items are scored as-is if they have no leading ‘-’ minus sign, but all items with a minus are reverse scored). We won’t bother recoding the data from the 1 - 4 scale to 0 - 3 as it makes little difference for your graphs.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>keys.list &lt;- list(c(&#39;Q1&#39;, &#39;Q2&#39;, &#39;-Q3&#39;, &#39;Q4&#39;, &#39;-Q5&#39;, &#39;Q6&#39;, &#39;Q7&#39;, &#39;-Q8&#39;, &#39;-Q9&#39;, &#39;-Q10&#39;))
df$total &lt;- scoreFast(keys.list, items = df[1:10], totals = TRUE, min = 1, max = 4)</code></pre>
<p>Now we have our dataset, we can look at comparing distributions. We might want to know if the distribution of self-esteem scores differs between men and women. Checking the codebook on the website, we can see that males are coded as ‘1’ and females as ‘2’.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>men &lt;- df %&gt;% 
  filter(gender == 1)
women &lt;- df %&gt;% 
  filter(gender == 2)</code></pre>
<p>So let’s plot the total self-esteem scores for the women in the sample as a simple histogram.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>hist(women$total)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019-10-12-plotting-multiple-histograms-on-the-same-graph_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="672" />
We can see a fairly normal distribution of scores. We can check the mean, but we might predict it is around 25.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>mean(women$total)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 25.74368</code></pre>
<p>Next we can add the men’s scores to the same plot. Here we simply create the first plot, then make a second plot with the argument <strong>add</strong> set to TRUE. We will set the density to 35 so we can see through the bars on the histogram.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>hist(women$total, col = &#39;red&#39;, main = &quot;Histogram of Total scores on Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale&quot;, xlab = &quot;Total score&quot;)
hist(men$total, add = TRUE, col = &#39;blue&#39;, density = 35)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019-10-12-plotting-multiple-histograms-on-the-same-graph_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>I have used the pipe to separate my data into individual gender dataframes, but this is only one way to do it, and I do find this code very easy to read. However, we could have done the same thing using a traditional R approach of indexing instead.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>hist(df$total[df$gender== 2], col = &#39;orchid&#39;, main = &quot;Histogram of Total scores on Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale&quot;, xlab = &quot;Total score&quot;)
hist(df$total[df$gender==1], add = TRUE, col = &#39;royalblue&#39;, density = 40)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019-10-12-plotting-multiple-histograms-on-the-same-graph_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Now we have seen the distributions, we might wonder if the sexes differ on the measure of self-esteem. Let’s run a quick t-test to see.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>t.test(men$total, women$total)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
##  Welch Two Sample t-test
## 
## data:  men$total and women$total
## t = 23.785, df = 37496, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16
## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  1.436304 1.694284
## sample estimates:
## mean of x mean of y 
##  27.30897  25.74368</code></pre>
<p>Yes they do! With men having a significantly higher mean score on self-esteem (though the absolute difference is quite small.)</p>
