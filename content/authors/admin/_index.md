I am a Senior Lecturer in Clinical Psychology at the School of Applied Psychology in University College Cork and a Clinical Psychologist in private practice. I am involved in all aspects of the doctoral programme in Clinical Psychology including teaching, research, selection and placement visits. I have specific responsibilities for  placement coordinator and lead the modules on Intellectual disabilities and Autism. I also contribute to the MA programme in Mental Health and supervise students for MA research projects. Since moving to the university in August 2017 I have started learning R as a tool for research, statistical analysis and text mining. I am still a novice, and my blog posts below are an attempt to explore some of the ways in which R can be used. Feel free to message me if you have ideas to improve the code or have other comments or feedback.
